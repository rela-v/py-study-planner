# py-study-planner: "üìù hard-mode studying for exams: in üêç Python!"

## What is py-study-planner?

This repo, py-study-planner, is an open source project under the MIT license that has a vision of providing students with a solution to the question: "How do I even study for this?"

## More about py-study-planner and how it was developed

The project py-study-planner began as a small project of 1 developer (myself) which resulted in plenty of barriers encountered, frustrations built, and back-to-the-drawing-board's, but always with a renewed sense of urgency and necessity. Having been in academia for a great portion of my life I recognize the need for something which can not only encourage students to study but can tell them how to study as well.
