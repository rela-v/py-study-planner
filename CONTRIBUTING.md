# How to contribute to py-study-planner (Adapted from the [Ruby on Rails CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))

## **please first read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before proceeding.**

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [issues]

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one under [issues]. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Use the available "bug report" template to get started.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. 

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable. Use the available "pull request" template to get started. Use the "Pull request" template.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [issues] and start writing code: fork the repository into your own account, then clone your forked repository to get a local copy (do not clone the main codebase). Use the available "feature request" template to get started.

* Once the issue has been reviewed and assigned, you may then create a PR. PR's that are not linked to assigned issues will not be approved. 

People like you make py-study-planner possible. Once again, if you'd like to contribute, feel free - but **please first read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**
